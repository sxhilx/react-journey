## Password Generator

In this project, I created a Password Generator app using React. Here's an overview of how I structured the app:

### State Management with `useState`

To manage the app's state, I used the `useState` hook. The following states were created:

- `length`: This controls the length of the generated password. It defaults to 8 characters and can be adjusted with a slider.
- `numbersAllowed`: A boolean value that determines whether numbers (0-9) are included in the password. This is controlled by a checkbox.
- `charAllowed`: A boolean value that decides whether special characters (e.g., `!#$%&()`) are included. This is also controlled by a checkbox.
- `password`: The actual password that gets generated and displayed in the input field.
- `buttonText`: The text displayed on the button, which changes from "Copy" to "Copied" once the user copies the password.

### Memoization with `useCallback`

I used the `useCallback` hook to memoize two functions: `passwordGenerator` and `copyPassword`. 

- **`passwordGenerator`**: This function generates a random password based on the current values of `length`, `numbersAllowed`, and `charAllowed`. By memoizing this function with `useCallback`, it ensures that the function is only re-created when one of its dependencies (`length`, `numbersAllowed`, `charAllowed`) changes. This helps in performance optimization by preventing unnecessary re-creations of the function on every render.

- **`copyPassword`**: This function allows the user to copy the generated password to the clipboard. It uses the `passwordRef` reference to select the password text and the `window.navigator.clipboard.writeText` method to copy it. It also updates the `buttonText` to "Copied" after a successful copy action.

### Password Generation Logic

- The password is generated by combining uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) as the default character set.
- If the `numbersAllowed` state is true, the set of characters is extended with digits (0-9).
- If `charAllowed` is true, the set is further extended with special characters like `!#$%&()*+-/<=>?@[]^_{|}~`.
- The password is created by randomly selecting characters from the generated character set based on the selected `length`.

### Copy to Clipboard

The password can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button. The button text changes to "Copied" once the password has been successfully copied.

### `useEffect` for Syncing State

The `useEffect` hook listens for changes in `length`, `numbersAllowed`, `charAllowed`, or `passwordGenerator`. Whenever any of these values change, the `passwordGenerator` function is called to regenerate the password. The button text is also reset to "Copy".

### The User Interface

- A text input is used to display the generated password. This input is read-only, allowing users to select and copy the password.
- A slider lets users choose the length of the password.
- Two checkboxes allow users to toggle whether numbers and special characters should be included in the password.
- A button allows users to copy the password to the clipboard.

### Conclusion

This app demonstrates the use of React hooks like `useState`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect` for managing state, optimizing performance, and responding to user input. By memoizing the `passwordGenerator` function with `useCallback`, the app avoids unnecessary re-renders and function recreations, improving its performance.
